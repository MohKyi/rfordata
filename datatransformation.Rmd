## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Prerequisites
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```
nycflights13
```{r}
flights
```
the tibble. You’ll learn what makes them different from regular data frames.

You might also have noticed the row of three (or four) letter abbreviations under the column names. These describe the type of each variable:

int stands for integers.
dbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.
chr stands for character vectors, or strings.
dttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).
lgl stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE.
fctr stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables with fixed possible values.
date stands for dates

#dplyr basics

Pick observations by their values (filter()).
Reorder the rows (arrange()).
Pick variables by their names (select()).
Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise())
These can all be used in conjunction with group_by()

#Filter rows with filter()
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```
#Logical operators
 Boolean operators yourself: & is “and”, | is “or”, and ! is “not”.
